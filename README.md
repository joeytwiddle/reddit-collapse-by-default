# reddit-collapse-by-default

All Reddit comments are collapsed by default so that only top level comments are readable. Their child comments are collapsed but visible for expanding/collapsing as needed, if the top level comment is interesting enough to dive into.

I am trying to test a hunch that I've had for some time that it would be better to read sibling comments first before deciding to go deeper onto any child comments.

Potential TODOs

- [x] Integrate with RES auto-remember feature
- [x] Show votes
- [ ] better UX through improved design

Questions, comments, issues and pull requests are welcome!
